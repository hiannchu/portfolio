            Traditional weather apps often rely on automated data that may not accurately reflect hyperlocal, real-time weather conditions, especially in outdoor settings like campgrounds, hiking trails, and remote areas.
            This lack of precision can make it challenging for outdoor enthusiasts—like hikers and campers—to plan their activities safely. Compared to other Australian weather apps like Weather Zone, many existing apps offer limited community-driven insights, meaning users miss out on firsthand weather reports from people who are actually on-site.
        </p>
        <p class="text-pretty xl:w-[60vw]">
            The solution aims to provide outdoor enthusiasts with a weather app to share real-time updates on weather and conditions at campsites, forests, trails, and other outdoor locations, helping them stay informed and prepared for the rapidly changing weather across Queensland.

                The user flow outlines the structure of Pixel Weather and how both guests and registered users interact with the platform. 
                Rectangles represent different screens, while diamonds indicate interaction points—color-coded to distinguish between actions available to all users and those exclusive to registered users.
                Below is an overview of the four main screens: Home, Map, Add Post, and Community.
